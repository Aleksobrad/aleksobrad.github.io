The Obradovic Lab focuses on development of novel approaches for analysis of transcriptional, TCR-Seq, and spatial data, at the bulk and single-cell level. We apply these tools across clinical trial data toward an improved understanding of the immunological mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, with an aim to infer and prioritize synergistic combination-therapies.
