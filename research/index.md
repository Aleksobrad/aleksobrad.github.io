Our research focus is on developing computational tools for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing and multimodal data types and applying these tools for improved understanding of tumor immunotherapy resistance mechanisms. With multiple mechanisms of treatment resistance present to varying degreees across tumor types and across patients, it is critical to understand tumor immune interactions within the microenvironment of solid tumors and develop a rational approach to combination therapy in treatment-resistant individuals.
