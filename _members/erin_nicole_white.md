My name is Erin White and I am a junior at Columbia University studying Neuroscience & Behavior on the pre-medical track. My research interests involve the intersection of neuroscience and medicine, with a passion to dive deeper into cellular biology and computational analysis. Outside of the lab, I enjoy competing on Columbia's Varsity Womenâ€™s Archery Team, running in Riverside Park, and visiting art museums!
