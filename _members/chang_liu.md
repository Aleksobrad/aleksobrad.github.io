I'm a bioengineer with specialized trainings in mechanobiology, mechanical engineering, tissue engineering, computer graphics, and deep learning. I'm interested in (1) providing immediate solutions to urgent medical issues with integrative biotechnology (organ-on-a-chip, early molecular diagnostics, biomaterials, multimodality image registration, wearable devices, and precision drug delivery etc.) (2) Spatio-temporal visualization/digitalization of fundamental biological processes (anatomical human body coordinates etc.). In my free time, I am interested in kayaking, fishing, badminton, performative arts, computer graphics and reading and nature. Currently working on combining computational methods for analysis of spatial RNA-Seq data with experimental methods for validation of cell-cell interaction, with a dual appointment in the Obradovic & Spina Labs.
